# post_processing_log-longtail
These post processing codes are used to present the results from IRGAN

Two kinds of results are used here: 1, log file, which is named as worker%3A0%3A0_results.log for example, 2. long tail file, which are d_ckpt_1.longtail.compare and g_ckpt_1.longtail.compare

plot_together.py can plot the above two kinds of results into one figure.
